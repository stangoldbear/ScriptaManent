## Project Vision

The goal is to create an open-source admin template that includes multiple example screens, prebuilt sections, and thoughtfully designed UI patterns, all supported by a clean architecture and proper project setup.

It aims to serve as a strong starting point for SaaS platforms, internal dashboards, and admin panels, with built-in support for multi-tenancy, RBAC, and feature-based scaling.

## Overview

This project uses `Next.js 15 (App Router)`, `TypeScript`, `Tailwind CSS v4`, and `Shadcn UI` as the main stack.  
It also includes `Zod` for validation, `ESLint` and `Prettier` for linting and formatting, and `Husky` for pre-commit hooks.  

This will support `React Hook Form`, `Zustand`, `TanStack Table`, and other related utilities, and will be added with upcoming screens. RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) with config-driven UI and multi-tenant UI support are also planned as part of the feature roadmap.

The current version uses the [Tweakcn Tangerine](https://tweakcn.com/) theme for UI.

> Looking for a **Next 14 + Tailwind CSS v3** version instead?  
> Check out the [`archive/next14-tailwindv3`](https://github.com/arhamkhnz/next-shadcn-admin-dashboard/tree/archive/next14-tailwindv3) branch.  
> This branch uses a different color theme and is not actively maintained, though I'm trying to keep it updated with the latest changes and screens.

## Colocation File System Architecture

The project follows a colocation-first file structure using the App Router. Feature-specific pages live alongside their components to maintain separation of concerns and reduce cross-import complexity.

â”œâ”€â”€ constants/                 # Static values like roles, app-level enums, routes, dummy data
```

## Getting Started

To set up and run this admin dashboard locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arhamkhnz/next-shadcn-admin-dashboard.git
   ```
   
2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
    npm install
   ```
   > While installing, you may be prompted to use the `--force` or `--legacy-peer-deps` flag.  
   > This is expected and safe â€” itâ€™s due to a dependency from the Shadcn registry that references a breaking library version.

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Once running, the app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
